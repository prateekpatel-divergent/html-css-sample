        A paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing
        with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more
        sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs
        are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer
        prose. Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students
        define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least
        five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality,
        though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what
        constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences
        or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116).
        Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a
        paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly
        journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.
        Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support
        one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the
        “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the
        paragraph. A paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing
